# Takanashi Kiara – Martyr

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I’ll be your exit route
Pound the gavel and sentence me to doom
Even though I’m just doing what you do
Decide which lies become the truth
No, you never really thought about it that far
Judging me when I can see you’ve got the same
scars
That’s the price that I pay, it’s a deep mark
Come, pick your sacrifice
Nail me to your crucifix
Nothing else can fix this
So I’ll take the blame
See yourself reflected and not corrected
One request, it’s:
Don’t be gentle
Don’t be kind when you
Murder, murder, murder the martyr
Poke their eyes out
Leave them blind
Murder, murder, murder the martyr
One request it’s -
Hypocrisy
I’ve seen what you do in private rings
All your friends yeah they know watcha really
think
To your glory, the masses keep on singing
Point at me in a hurry
Pick a scapegoat for the new controversy
Even when I’m buried, hidden, silent, you’ll
be wary
Please dear God show them mercy
Uh
Nail me to your crucifix
Nothing else can fix this
So I’ll take the blame
See yourself reflected and not corrected
One request, it’s:
Don’t be gentle
Don’t be kind when you
Murder, murder, murder the martyr
Poke their eyes out
Leave them blind
Murder, murder, murder the martyr
One request it’s -
Break me now
(break, break, break, break, break)
Take me down ~
(Do you love me?) (Do you love me?)
Me down ~
(break, break, break, break, break)
(Do you love me?) (Do you love me?)
One request it’s -
I see your sins
And they’re in your soul
Consume and ignore
Decay to your core
I’ll never win to you
but within you’ll ~
(break, break, break, break)
And when I ~
(break, break, break, break)
You will ~
(break, break, break, break)
Break, Break, Break, Break ~
And in your hands, the hammer pounds the nail in
Don’t be gentle
Don’t be kind when you
Murder, murder, murder the martyr
Poke their eyes out
Leave them blind
Murder, murder, murder the martyr
One request it’s -
Do you love me?
Again ~ Again ~ Again ~
Do you love me?
One request it’s -
Do you love me?
Again ~ Again ~ Again ~

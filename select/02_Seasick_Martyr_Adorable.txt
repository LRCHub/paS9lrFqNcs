Well the ship's in the harbor
Harbor no fear
With the words of her father
Ringing in her ears
She's sunshine and seasick
And the salt water taste
And the waves on the beach heads
Laughing around her face

And her uncle said
That the snow came too soon
It hardly ever happens here
And least of all in June

The seagulls above
The crumbling pier
And she never knew love
But she knew how to disappear
Isn't the sun far away?
And isn't the sea cold today?
And isn't the sun far away?
And don't you just wish you could drift away?

And her uncle said
That the snow came too soon
It hardly ever happens here
And least of all in June

When she saw the snow
She knew it was a sign from the man in the know
Oh god, let her go
Oh god, let her go
Oh god, let her go
Oh god! Let her go! Let her go! Let her!
Go!

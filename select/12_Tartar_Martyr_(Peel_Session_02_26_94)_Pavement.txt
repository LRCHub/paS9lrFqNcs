The reception
I know it's going to be alright
Getting cooler
I know it's going to be alright
Getting cooler
But I'm out of feeling you
Getting cooler
That doesn't mean I don't need you
The reception
My reception
If there's a way to hide from you
I'll take my time
I know that it's true
True

Getting cooler
But I'm out of the loop
Getting cooler
Doesn't' mean I don't want you
Cooler
Cooler
Cooler, cooler

If there's a way to hide from you
I'll take my time cause I know that it's true
Ooh
Tartar
Tartar
Martyr
Tartar
La la la la
Ooh
The reception is over
My life is just beginning to bloom
